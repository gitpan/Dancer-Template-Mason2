NAME
    Dancer::Template::Mason2 - Mason 2.x wrapper for Dancer

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
      # in 'config.yml'
      template: 'mason2'

      # in the app
 
      get '/foo', sub {
        template 'foo' => {
            title => 'bar'
        };
      };

    Then, in `views/foo.mc':

        <%args>
        $.title
        </%args>

        <h1><% $.title %></h1>

        <p>Mason says hi!</p>

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's template engine abstraction
    layer and the Mason 2.x templating system.

    In order to use this engine, set the template to 'mason2' in the
    configuration file:

        template: mason2

    The default template extension is ".mc".

CONFIGURATION
    Parameters can also be passed to `Mason->new' via the configuration
    file, like so:

        engines:
            mason2:
                data_dir: /path/to/data_dir

    `comp_root', if not specified, defaults to the `views' configuration
    setting or, if it's undefined, to the `/views' subdirectory of the
    application.

    `data_dir', if not specified, defaults to the `/data' subdirectory of
    the application.
